ACP <i>de novo</i> transcriptome

We identified a number of missing and incomplete genes during our detailed manual curation and orthology analysis of the <i>D. citri</i> genome, so we created a genome-independent <i>de novo</i> transcriptome to generate a more comprehensive set of transcripts. The transcriptome set was generated using 1.4 billion short and long individual reads from a range of experimental conditions and tissue types. This resulted in 40,637 genes and 60,261 transcripts with an average length of 1,736.1 bp and contig N50 of 3,657 bp. To differentiate transcripts in downstream analysis we assigned transcript identifiers according to the transcript evidence source. The DcDTr identifier prefix corresponds to 41,457 transcripts assembled from short read RNA sequencing data. And, the DcDTi identifier prefix was assigned to 18,804 transcripts supported by long read Iso-Seq data. Functional descriptions were assigned to 27,813 transcripts. We later added nine genome-independent transcripts (from seven genes) that were identified during manual curation. Most of these came from the MCOT transcriptome we described previously. The transcriptome was validated with the hemipteran BUSCO data set and has 94.2% complete single-copy orthologs, and only 3.2 % missing single-copy orthologs.
